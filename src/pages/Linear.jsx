            Big-O Notation is a way of describing how quickly an algorithm runs.
            It is an estimate of the number of operations (or steps) an
            algorithm will take to complete, given a certain number of inputs.
            Basically, Big-O notation allows you to compare the complexity of
            different algorithms. In other words, it can be used to measure how
            efficient an algorithm is in terms of time, memory or computation.
            To put it simply, the Big-O notation gives you an idea of how long
            something will take to run. The most commonly used Big-O notations
            are O(n), O(log n) and O(n2).
